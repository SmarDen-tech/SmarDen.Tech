## SmarDen For Developers 
Smarden.tech is a platform for Internet of Things and it is for the developers and the IoT enthusiasts who are working in the field of Internet of Things and want a complete one stop solution for the MQTT, Cloud, Back-end and Dashboard.

 For Any Internet of Things device it is important to have three basic things lined up. 
 - Hardware: The Hardware is the basic block for any IoT device, the device can be of two type, first one is where you can perform the operations and second one is from where you can get the data. consider Actuators and sensors are two different things that we need along with the microcontroller for making any IoT Hardware, so that we can control the device and get the data from the device remotely from anywhere in the world. 

 - Cloud: Then after deploying the hardware, our goal for the device is to control and monitor it remotely with our mobile application from any part of the world. To achieve this we will be needing a complete cloud infrastructure and we need to connect to connect our device and the Dashboard to the same server so that the communication can happen, in the case of IoT we use the protocol of MQTT for this complete infrastructure and we use a real-time data base as the data storage unit. 

 - Application: After the data is sent to the cloud we need a front-end application to perform operations on the device and to monitor the data that the device is sharing. Then we need to design a particular web-app or mobile app to do all these things. 

## What is SmarDen.tech? 

SmarDen for Developers is an online IoT platform designed for the Enthusiasts like you. It gives you complete freedom to design your projects from scratch, you take care of the devices and we’ll take care of the backend, cloud and dashboard.
As an electronic hobbyist, focusing on the device level and tinkering with the device is more important then to worry about the software. Develop your IoT devices and focus on the Hardware, rest all is taken care by us.
Integrating your end devices with the cloud and the making the front-end to access the data was never been much easier, With our platform it will take you less than 5 mins to onboard your device to cloud. 
Accessing the meaningful information is always the main concern, with our user friendly dashboard and mobile application, monitor and control your devices in a blink of an eye from any part of the world. 

### Shifting to SmarDen.tech 
1. <b>Registration: </b>The first step is to create your user account, where you will be asked to enter your name, email id and phone number, and please enter the correct email id, so that you can get the password to login and can verify your account.
  

2. <b>Login: </b>Here you can login into the dashboard with your correct Username and Password.
 
3. <b>My Instance: </b>Here you need to create an instance for using the MQTT server and to connect your devices to the smarden.tech platfom. You need to create a unique username and password as your Smarden tech instance

4. <b>Dashboard: </b>On the Dashboard, you'll get the complete overview about all the devices and elements that you've created. You can access those devices, control them and monitor them from your Dashboard. Moreover, you'll also get to know about the device status and signal Strength. It is a complete overview of all the things that are related with your device. 

5. <b>Components: </b>There are different components that you can integrate with your SmarDen Dashboard. The Hierarchy goes that way - Groups -> Devices -> Elements. 
  - Groups: First you need to create a group so that you can add multiple devices in that group. The Group name can be anything like Sensors, Living Room, Switches, Bed Room etc. 
  - Devices: After creating the Group, you can now create your own device by clicking on the devices option. Here you can choose a device name like "LED" or "Fan", then you need to select a group and then click on create. Once the device is Created you'll be seeing the "Device ID" associated with that device. You'll be needing that device ID while programming you IoT device. 
  - Elements: In the Elements section, you can create a UI element that will help you in monitoring or controlling your IoT Device. You can click on "Add button" to add an element in to the dashboard. 
It will ask you about the "Component Name", here you need to enter the name of your element. 
Then you'll have to select a device under which you want to create this element. 
Then you need to select the device type - either it be a sensor or a switch. 

Further when you'll choose a device type, you'll get different option for different type of device. 
- For Sensors there are widgets, notifications, gauge.
- For Switches there are Toggle buttons, Push Buttons, Sliders, Colour Picker. 

You can select any of these elments and it will be reflected on the dashboard. 
Once the element is created, you'll see the list of elements along with their specific "Element ID" and "Device ID". 

* You'll be needing these element IDs and Device IDs while programming your IoT Hardware.
